## 🎯 Overview

### Research Question
Can simple lymphoedema management (foot hygiene, elevation, footwear) significantly reduce disability and depressive symptoms in podoconiosis patients over 24 months?

### Context
- **Disease:** Podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis from volcanic soil exposure)
- **Location:** North West Region, Cameroon
- **Population:** 199 patients enrolled, 161 completed full follow-up (81% retention)
- **Duration:** March 2019 - March 2022
- **Study Type:** Prospective interventional study with repeated measures

### What Makes This Study Novel

| Feature | Innovation |
|---------|-----------|
| **Dual outcome assessment** | First study to simultaneously evaluate disability (WHODAS 2.0) AND depression (PHQ-9) |
| **Extended follow-up** | Longest prospective study in Cameroon (24 months vs. previous cross-sectional studies) |
| **Compliance analysis** | Quantified adherence effects using validated hygiene assessment tool |
| **Economic impact** | First national productivity calculation for podoconiosis treatment in Africa |
| **Detailed domain analysis** | Used IRT scoring for granular disability subscale assessment |

---

## 🔬 Research Significance

### The Problem Addressed

**Podoconiosis in Cameroon:**
- ~41,556 estimated cases nationwide
- Prevalence up to 8.1% in endemic highland areas
- Only 1 treatment center for entire country
- Limited evidence on treatment effectiveness

**Patient Burden:**
- 65% experience depression at baseline
- Average 2.6 days/month unable to work
- 46% have acute inflammatory attacks monthly
- Profound social stigma and isolation

### Knowledge Gaps Filled

**Before this study:**
- ❌ No long-term disability data from Cameroon
- ❌ No evidence linking treatment to mental health improvement
- ❌ Unknown economic benefits of intervention
- ❌ Unclear if compliance level affects outcomes

**After this study:**
- ✅ 24-month longitudinal disability data
- ✅ Validated mental health outcome measurements
- ✅ Quantified productivity gains and national impact
- ✅ Differential effects of compliance on physical vs. mental health

## 🔧 Key Methodological Contributions

### 1. Dual Scoring Approach for WHODAS 2.0

**Innovation:** Combined simple and IRT-based scoring methods

```R
# Simple scoring (overall disability)
simple_score <- (sum(items_1_to_12) / 48) * 100

# IRT scoring (domain-specific analysis)
domain_scores <- list(
  cognition = (S3 + S6) / 8 * 100,
  mobility = (S1 + S7) / 8 * 100,
  self_care = (S8 + S9) / 6 * 100,
  getting_along = (S10 + S11) / 4 * 100,
  life_activities = (S2 + S12) / 6 * 100,
  participation = (S4 + S5) / 6 * 100
)

# Subscale aggregation
activity_limitation <- (S1 + S3 + S6 + S7 + S8 + S9) / 22 * 100
participation_restriction <- (S2 + S4 + S5 + S10 + S11 + S12) / 16 * 100
```

**Why this matters:**
- Simple scoring: Tracks overall change for clinical decisions
- IRT scoring: Identifies which life domains improve most
- Subscales: Differentiates physical vs. social disability

### 2. Compliance Quantification

**Innovation:** Objective scoring system combining self-report and observation

**Hygiene Assessment Scoring:**

| Component | Points | Assessment Method |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Washing frequency | 0-3 | Self-report |
| Soap use | 0-1 | Self-report + observation |
| Elevation practice | 0-3 | Self-report |
| Footwear use | 0-2 | Observation |
| Skin cleanliness | 0-6 | Independent observer |
| Nail care | 0-3 | Independent observer |
| Wound status | 0-3 | Independent observer |
| Facility availability | 0-9 | Observation |
| **Total** | **0-30** | **Mixed** |

**Compliance Classification:**
- Good compliance: Mean score ≥24.5 across visits
- Poor compliance: Mean score <24.5
- Cut-off based on sample mean (data-driven threshold)

### 3. Mixed-Effects Modeling for Compliance

**Model Specification:**

```R
# Disability model
lmer(WHODAS_score ~ 
       time * compliance_status +  # Interaction term
       age + sex + education + marital_status +  # Covariates
       (1 | participant_id),  # Random intercept
     data = long_data,
     REML = TRUE)

# Depression model (same structure)
lmer(PHQ9_score ~ 
       time * compliance_status + 
       age + education +  # Reduced covariates (sex not sig)
       (1 | participant_id),
     data = long_data,
     REML = TRUE)
```

**Why mixed models:**
- Accounts for repeated measures within individuals
- Handles missing data (not just completers)
- Tests time × compliance interaction
- Estimates marginal means at each timepoint

### 4. Economic Impact Extrapolation

**Calculation Method:**

```R
# Individual level
workdays_gained_per_month <- mean(baseline_days) - mean(endpoint_days)
# = 2.6 - 1.3 = 1.3 days/month

# Study cohort (24 months)
total_days_gained <- 161 * 1.3 * 24
# = 5,023 person-days

# National extrapolation
national_cases <- 41556  # From Deribe et al. 2018
national_days_gained <- national_cases * 1.3 * 24 / 12  # Per year
# = 1,296,768 person-days/year

# Convert to person-years
person_years_gained <- national_days_gained / 365
# = 3,553 person-years over 24 months
```

**Assumptions:**
1. Treatment effects generalise to all Cameroon cases
2. Adherence rates in scaled programs similar to the trial
3. Baseline disability comparable across regions
4. Linear extrapolation (conservative estimate)

## 📈 Preliminary Findings

> ⚠️ **Note:** Detailed results are reserved for peer-reviewed publication. Summary statistics provided here for methodological transparency and portfolio purposes.

### Sample Characteristics (N=161 completers)

| Characteristic | n (%) or Mean±SD |
|----------------|------------------|
| Age (years) | 42.5 ± 11.8 |
| Female sex | 146 (90.7%) |
| Education (years) | 9.6 ± 6.1 |
| Married/partnered | 84 (52.2%) |
| Farmers/self-employed | 125 (77.6%) |
| Both legs affected (stage 2-3) | 108 (67.1%) |

### Primary Outcomes: Direction of Change

**Disability (WHODAS 2.0):**
- Baseline → 12 months: Significant decrease (p<0.001)
- Baseline → 24 months: Significant decrease (p<0.001)
- 12 months → 24 months: Modest increase (p<0.05)
- **Pattern:** Large initial improvement, sustained benefits with slight attenuation

**Depression (PHQ-9):**
- Baseline → 12 months: Significant decrease (p<0.001)
- Baseline → 24 months: Significant decrease (p<0.001)
- 12 months → 24 months: Small increase (not significant)
- **Pattern:** Substantial improvement maintained over 24 months

**Workdays Lost:**
- Baseline → 24 months: Significant decrease (p<0.001)
- Mean change: 1.3 days/month gained
- **Pattern:** Economic productivity substantially recovered

### Domain-Specific Findings

All six WHODAS 2.0 domains showed significant improvement (p<0.001 for all):

| Domain | Direction | Relative Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Cognition | ↓↓↓ | Large effect |
| Mobility | ↓↓ | Moderate effect |
| Self-care | ↓↓↓ | Large effect |
| Getting along | ↓↓↓ | Large effect |
| Life activities | ↓↓ | Moderate effect |
| Participation | ↓↓↓ | Very large effect |

**Key observation:** Social/participation domains improved more dramatically than physical domains (mobility, self-care)—suggests intervention addresses stigma and isolation, not just physical symptoms.

### Compliance Effects

**Finding:** Differential impact on outcomes

| Outcome | Compliance Effect | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Disability | No significant difference (p=0.408) | Physical benefits occur regardless of adherence level |
| Depression | Significant difference (p=0.008) | Mental health requires consistent engagement |

**Clinical implication:** Even imperfect adherence provides value—programs should prioritise access over perfect compliance.

### Sociodemographic Patterns

**Baseline associations attenuated post-intervention:**
- Age ≥45 years: Higher depression at baseline → No difference at 24 months
- Farmers: Higher depression at baseline → No difference at 24 months
- **Interpretation:** Intervention may reduce health inequities
